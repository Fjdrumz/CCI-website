          <h2>Know it</h2>
          <p>
            At Celebration Church, the word of God is emphasized to ensure every
            member knows and understands the lordship of Jesus, and experiences
            progress and joy in the faith.

          <h2>Live it</h2>
          <p>
            Your life should reflect the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ
            every single day. It’s not enough to simply know that Jesus is
            Lord—you must live out that truth in everything you do.

          <h2>Tell it</h2>
          <p>
            Celebrating the finished work of Jesus means sharing it with the
            world. We are called to boldly proclaim His love and grace to as
            many people as we can.
