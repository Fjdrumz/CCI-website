          Celebration Church International (CCI) is a mission-minded teaching
          ministry founded in 2012 by Apostle Emmanuel Iren. Our vision is to
          see all people celebrate endless life in Christ Jesus and fully
          embrace the power of His death, burial, and resurrection
          <br />
          <br />
          <br />
          At CCI, we are committed to knowing Christ deeply and making Him known
          across the world. We nurture spiritual growth through in-depth
          teaching services, powerful prayer sessions, and outreach programs,
          empowering believers to live out their faith boldly. Our services are
          marked by the gifts of the Spirit, where prayer, prophecies, and
          spiritual songs flow freely in an atmosphere of worship.

          We hold firmly to the Word of God as the ultimate standard for
          doctrine, and we believe that the greatest demonstration of God's love
          is found in the redemptive work of Christ. Through His grace, we are
          blessed and righteous in His sight.
          <br />
          <br />
          <br />
          Under Apostle Emmanuel Iren's leadership, CCI has grown from a campus
          fellowship into a global ministry with over 15,000 members and And
          with more than 30 campuses across Nigeria, the Europe, Canada, and the
          USA. We are the hands and feet of Christ, spreading the gospel to the
          uttermost parts of the earth. A billion souls, in 10,000 cities!
          Christ.
